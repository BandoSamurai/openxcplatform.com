    <h1>Vehicle Trace Files</h1>
</div>

There are a number of trace files available that exhibit different scenarios and
driving behaviors.

These files are delivered as gzip compressed files, so if you download one and
it seems to be corrupted binary, try again using an updated browser - it should
auto-detect an uncompress when you download:

<div class="alert alert-error">
     Some Android devices' browsers will continue to have problems
     with the gzipped files.  Skip to the next section to get
     uncompressed traces if you are having problems on Android.
