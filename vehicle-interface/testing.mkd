Make sure that the tablet and CAN translator module are out of the way of the
driver. They should be securely held down or preferably with another person in
the passenger seat. The OBD-II and USB cables should also be routed away from
the brake and accelerator pedals to avoid getting tangled. You should also avoid
draping the cablse over the steering wheel, as they can get caught in the
turning mechanism and make steering difficult.

We recommend keeping the CAN translator between seats or on the passenger seat,
with the OBD-II cable routed along the floor on the driver's side, around the
back of the seat and up between the seats.

Most importantly, *do not* try to test your application while in motion! Testing
OpenXC apps while moving is absolutely a two person job.

    <h2>Source Code</h2>
</div>

The [cantranslator][] repository (only accessible if logged in to GitHub and
with access to the early release) contains the C source code that runs on the
Arduino-compatible chipKIT device. Most OpenXC users won't need to touch this
component - they will most likely be using a pre-built binary on the vehicle
interface that knows about proprietary vehicle signals.

<div class="page-header">
    <h2>Data Reader</h2>
</div>

The `reader.py` Python program in this repository can be used to view the output
of the CAN translator over micro-USB. Just plug it in and run the script with
the `--verbose` flag to have all messages parsed and printed to stdout.

{% highlight sh %}
$ python reader.py -v
