### Custom CAN Signal Definition

Developers that know the details of the CAN bus they will be using can choose to
implement their own signal definitions for the translator. The documentation for
this process is available at the [cantranslator][] repository (only accessible
if logged in to GitHub and with access to the early release).

### Updating from a .hex file

Updates to the translator source may be distributed as pre-compiled binaries,
e.g. if they are distributed by an OEM who does not wish to make the CAN signals
public.

In this case, you will have a .hex file and can use the `upload_hex.sh` script
to update your device. This script requires that `avrdude` is installed, or that
you have the `MPIDE_DIR` environment variable pointing to a valid MPIDE
installation (see the "Command Line Building" section above for details). Once
that's setup, run it like so:

{% highlight sh %}
$ ./upload_hex.sh new-version.hex
{% endhighlight %}

Note that if you are using Windows, you also need to install the
[FTDI driver](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm) - get the setup
executable version from that page.
