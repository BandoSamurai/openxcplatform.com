    <h1>Projects</h1>
</div>

This page serves as a home for example projects built on the OpenXC platform. If
you have a project of your own, fork the [openxc.github.com][] project on GitHub
(that's this site!), add a new page for your project with links to the code and
hardware schematics (if you have them) and send a pull request. We will include
as many well documented, functional projects as we can.

Don't miss the creative projects from [OpenXC hackathons and other
events](/community/events.html), too.
