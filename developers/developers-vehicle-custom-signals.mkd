Custom CAN Signal Definition
=============

Developers that know the details of the CAN bus they will be using can choose to
implement their own signal definitions for the translator. The documentation for
this process is available at the [cantranslator][] repository (only accessible
if logged in to GitHub and with access to the early release).
