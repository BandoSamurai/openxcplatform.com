You can get started using OpenXC without any hardware, but to use it in a live
vehicle you need a few parts.

You need a **compatible vehicle interface (VI)**.

<a href="/vehicle-interface/hardware.html">
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">
See all supported VIs
</button>
</a>

You need a **compatible host device**, most likely an Android tablet or phone.

<a href="/host-devices/index.html">
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">
See all host devices
</button>
</a>

To run with live data, you need a **compatible vehicle**.
