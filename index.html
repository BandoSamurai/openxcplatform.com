    <h1>The OpenXC Platform</h1>
    <p>
        OpenXC&trade; is a combination of open source hardware and software that
        lets you extend your vehicle with custom applications and
        pluggable modules. It uses standard, well-known tools to open up
        a wealth of data from the vehicle to developers, even beyond OBD-II.

        <h2>What is OpenXC&trade;?</h2>
        <p>
            OpenXC&trade; is a data-focused API for your car and by installing a
            small hardware module, the vehicle data becomes accessible
            to Android or other desktop applications using the OpenXC library.

        <h2>Unlocking Rich Vehicle Data</h2>
        <p>
            OpenXC&trade; allows consumer devices, such as smart phones, to access
            data from any vehicle. Using OpenXC&trade;, you can monitor many of the
            sensors on a vehicle, enabling new and innovative vehicle-centric
            applications. Some data is required by law and more can be unlocked
            with support from an automaker - or a little reverse engineering
            effort!
