    <h2>What is OpenXC?</h2>
    <p>
        OpenXC is your car's API. Install it in your car to crack the
        door of the black box sitting in your driveway.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ford Motor Company and <a href="#">Bug Labs</a> joined up to
        create a standard way of interfacing with and creating software
        and hardware for vehicles. Every new car is full of computers
        and electronics, and there is growing interest in connecting the
        data from those systems to applications and the web. Many
        companies are already offering programmable interface, but what
        if the system was designed from the ground up to be open source?
        OpenXC imagines when your car is as easy to program as your
        smartphone.
    </p>

    <p>
        Today's version of OpenXC runs on a combination of the
        <a href="#">Arduino</a> and <a href="#">Android</a> platforms.
        It uses tools you already known and opens up thousands of
        possibilities.
    </p>

    <h2>What can it do?</h2>

    <p>
        Plug the OpenXC <a href="#">vehicle interface</a> into your car
        and from Android, you can read data from the vehicle in
        real-time like the <a href="#">steering wheel angle</a>,
        <a href="#">GPS position</a> and <a href="#">vehicle speed</a>.
        Right now, OpenXC supports over a dozen different measurements.
    </p>

    <p>
        To start, take advantage of the <a href="#">GPS antenna</a> on
        the roof of the car to improve the accuracy of your location
        aware application. Then get crazy and make graphic arts based on
        your <a href="#">steering wheel</a> activity and upload it
        directly to the web.
    </p>

    <h2>How can I write OpenXC applications?</h2>

    <p>
        You can get started right away without any hardware - check out
        the <a href="#">tutorial</a> to being. When you're ready to test
        in a vehicle you'll need to buy or build the
        <a href="#">vehicle interface</a> and make sure you have a
        compatible <a herf="#">Android device</a>. Check out the
        <a href="#">required hardware</a> for details.
