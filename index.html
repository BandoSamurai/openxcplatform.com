            <h2>What is OpenXC?</h2>
            <p>
                OpenXC is your car's API. Install it in your car to crack the
                door of the black box sitting in your driveway.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ford Motor Company and <a href="#">Bug Labs</a> joined up to
                create a standard way of interfacing with and creating software
                and hardware for vehicles. Every new car is full of computers
                and electronics, and there is growing interest in connecting the
                data from those systems to applications and the web. Many
                companies are already offering programmable interface, but what
                if the system was designed from the ground up to be open source?
                OpenXC imagines when your car is as easy to program as your
                smartphone.
            </p>

            <p>
                Today's version of OpenXC runs on a combination of the
                <a href="#">Arduino</a> and <a href="#">Android</a> platforms.
                It uses tools you already known and opens up thousands of
                possibilities.
            </p>

            <h2>What can it do?</h2>

            <p>
                Plug the OpenXC <a href="#">vehicle interface</a> into your car
                and from Android, you can read data from the vehicle in
                real-time like the <a href="#">steering wheel angle</a>,
                <a href="#">GPS position</a> and <a href="#">vehicle speed</a>.
                Right now, OpenXC supports over a dozen different measurements.
            </p>

            <p>
                To start, take advantage of the <a href="#">GPS antenna</a> on
                the roof of the car to improve the accuracy of your location
                aware application. Then get crazy and make graphic arts based on
                your <a href="#">steering wheel</a> activity and upload it
                directly to the web.
            </p>

            <h2>How can I write OpenXC applications?</h2>

            <p>
                You can get started right away without any hardware - check out
                the <a href="#">tutorial</a> to being. When you're ready to test
                in a vehicle you'll need to buy or build the
                <a href="#">vehicle interface</a> and make sure you have a
                compatible <a herf="#">Android device</a>. Check out the
                <a href="#">required hardware</a> for details.
            </p>
