            <h1>The OpenXC Platform</h1>
            <p>
                OpenXC is combination of open source hardware and software that lets you
                extend your vehicle with custom applications and pluggable modules. It
                uses standard, well-known tools to open up a wealth of data from the
                vehicle to developers.

                <h2>What is OpenXC?</h2>
                <p>
                    OpenXC is an API to your car - by installing a small hardware module to
                    read and translate metrics from a car's internal network, the data
                    becomes accessible from most Android applications using the OpenXC
                    library. You can start making vehicle-aware applications that have
                    better interfaces based on context, can minimize distraction while
                    driving, are integrated with other connected services, and can offer the
                    consumer more insight into their car's operation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ford Motor Company and
                    <a href="http://www.buglabs.net/ford-buglabs">Bug Labs</a> joined up to
                    create a standard way of creating aftermarket software and hardware for
                    vehicles. Every new car is full of computers and electronics, and there
                    is growing interest in connecting the output from those systems to
                    third-party applications and the web. Many companies are already
                    offering tools to hook into the driver's interface, but for the most
                    part they have limited availability for hobbyists and developers. What if
                    the system was designed from the ground up to be open source and to give
                    insight into the vehicle itself? With proper hardware isolation to
                    ensure you can't "brick" your $20,000 investment in a car, OpenXC
                    imagines when your car is as easy to program as your smartphone.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Today's version of OpenXC runs on a combination of the
                    <a href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a> and
                    <a href="http://developer.android.com">Android</a> platforms.
                    It uses tools you already known and opens up thousands of
                    possibilities.
                </p>

                <h2>What can it do?</h2>

                <p>
                    Plug the OpenXC vehicle interface into your car and from Android, you
                    can read data from the vehicle in real-time like the steering wheel
                    angle GPS position and vehicle speed. Right now, OpenXC supports over a
                    dozen different measurements on a growing list of Ford vehicles.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A simple start is to take advantage of the GPS antenna on the roof of
                    the car to improve the accuracy of your location aware application. Or
                    get creative - why not generate a digital painting based on your
                    steering wheel movements over the course of a day, and upload it
                    directly to the web? No single company can think of all possibilities
                    for applications, and that's why OpenXC gives the freedom of
                    experimentation to developers.
                </p>
