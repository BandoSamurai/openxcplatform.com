    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
</div>

Modern automobiles are laced with a number of microcontrollers and sensors that
monitor and control everything from the throttle position to the ambient air
temperature. These devices communicate with each other over a wired in-vehicle
network, a [CAN bus][can].

Did you just buy a <a href="/vehicle-interface/index.html">vehicle interface</a> and you
want to do a quick "smoke test" and verify it works? <strong>Jump ahead to the <a

![In-vehicle Network](/images/can-diagram.png)

The CAN bus is one of the primary components of [OBD-II][obd2], a vehicle
diagnostic standard mandatory for all cars sold in the United States since 1996.
The OBD-II standard sends and receives messages on the CAN bus. If you've ever
watched your mechanic plug a tool in somewhere underneath your steering wheel,
or seen a vehicle monitoring app for your smartphone, that's OBD-II in action.
You'll always find the port by the driver's knees.

This means that every vehicle in the United States has a very accessible place
to connect to the same network used by all of the vehicle's subsystems. That's
where OpenXC comes in - with some knowledge of how to process the messages on
the network, you can start to get valuable data out of your car.

The OpenXC architecture is divided into **two parts**:

![Boxed vehicle interface](/images/cantranslator-boxed.jpg)

The <a href="/vehicle-interface/index.html">**vehicle interface (VI)**</a> is a
device that plugs into the OBD-II port (and thus to the CAN bus), reads and
translates CAN messages into a [standard cross-vehicle
format](/vehicle-interface/output-format.html). The translated messages can be
sent over USB or Bluetooth, so they can be read by any computer or smartphone.

    </div>
</div>

The <a href="/host-devices/index.html">**host device**</a> connects to the
vehicle interface and reads the translated vehicle data (e.g. an Android tablet
or Python environement on a laptop). OpenXC developers can write applications on
this device using the data.

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
</div>

When you're ready to begin writing an OpenXC app, continue on to
[install the Android library](/getting-started/library-installation.html). You
can get started even if you don't have a hardware vehicle interface (or even a
car!).

If you're interested in creating a web application instead and want to leave the
in-vehicle details to someone else, jump to the [vehicle data
format](/vehicle-interface/output-format.html) section to know what type of data
your app needs to accept.
